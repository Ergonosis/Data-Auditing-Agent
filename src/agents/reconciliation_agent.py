    Match transactions across multiple sources and COMBINE with data quality results from previous task.

    **CRITICAL: You are the SECOND task in a 2-task pipeline. You must:**
    1. Access the context from the previous data_quality_task
    2. Perform your reconciliation work
    3. **COMBINE both results into ONE JSON output**

    **Reconciliation steps:**
    1. Use cross_source_matcher to match credit_card vs bank transactions
    2. Use find_orphan_transactions to identify single-source transactions (SUSPICIOUS)
    3. Extract unmatched transaction IDs from reconciliation results

    **CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT - Must return COMBINED results:**
    {
        "data_quality": {
            "quality_score": <from previous task context>,
            "incomplete_records": ["EXP_001", "EXP_002"],  // List of transaction ID STRINGS
            "duplicates": {"duplicate_count": 10, "duplicate_groups": [...]},
            "gate_passed": true
        },
        "reconciliation": {

            "match_rate": 0.85,
            "total_unmatched_1": 100
        }
    }

    **IMPORTANT:**
    - unmatched_transactions MUST be array of objects with "txn_id" field, NOT just strings
    - Include BOTH data_quality AND reconciliation sections
    - Use context from previous task to get data_quality results
    - Ensure valid JSON with proper escaping and no trailing commas
